Edu-Portal is an e-governance schools management system, designed to digitalize the existing schools. This platform brings all the schools together into one roof, facilitating the government to monitor and manage them.

This is just a prototype with limited functionality. The developed application has the following end users:
a)Government Representative
[Digitize/add School, View their statistics ]
b)School Administrator
[Add Teacher,Student; send notifications]
c)Teacher
[Mark attendance & marks]
d)Student
[View attendace, marks & notification]

The E-mitra payments service can be embeded to facilitate fee & salary management. Similarly Aadhar can be associated with every student using Aadhar api.

The following are the advantages that we get:
> Government can keep a track about students
> Students can get to know the right affiliation details of the school(eradicating the problem of fake affiliations)
> Both Students and parents can know the result of the student any time (even if they miss parent-teacher meetings)
> By including the attendance feedback system(currently not available in the prototype) the government can know the cause of low attendance and can take measures accordingly.
  Eg. If attendance is low due to ill-health, then medical camps can be conducted.
      If the number of students enrolled are less according to population statistics then Social welfare organizations and NSS can be involved to conduct awareness programs.
> The mid-day meals outreach/inventory consumption can be tracked with the help of student attendance.

Similarly many features & services can be added to provide a complete management software.

This application can be rolled out as an emitra service for all the end users!
